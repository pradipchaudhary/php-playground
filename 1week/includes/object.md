# Object

Certainly! PHP objects are instances of classes, which are templates for creating objects. Classes in PHP define properties and methods that the objects created from the class will have. Here's a detailed explanation of PHP object syntax with sections including syntax, examples, key points, and use cases.

### 1. Defining a Class

A class in PHP is defined using the `class` keyword followed by the class name and a pair of curly braces `{}`.

#### Syntax:

```php
class ClassName {
    // Properties
    // Methods
}
```

#### Example:

```php
class Person {
    public $firstName;
    public $lastName;
    public $age;

    public function __construct($firstName, $lastName, $age) {
        $this->firstName = $firstName;
        $this->lastName = $lastName;
        $this->age = $age;
    }

    public function fullName() {
        return $this->firstName . " " . $this->lastName;
    }
}
```

### 2. Creating an Object

Objects are created using the `new` keyword followed by the class name and parentheses `()`.

#### Syntax:

```php
$objectName = new ClassName();
```

#### Example:

```php
$person = new Person("John", "Doe", 30);
```

### 3. Accessing Properties and Methods

Properties and methods of an object are accessed using the `->` operator.

#### Syntax:

```php
$objectName->propertyName;
$objectName->methodName();
```

#### Example:

```php
echo $person->firstName; // Output: John
echo $person->fullName(); // Output: John Doe
```

### 4. Constructor Method

The constructor method is a special method named `__construct` that is called automatically when an object is created. It is used to initialize properties of the class.

#### Syntax:

```php
public function __construct($param1, $param2) {
    $this->property1 = $param1;
    $this->property2 = $param2;
}
```

#### Example:

```php
public function __construct($firstName, $lastName, $age) {
    $this->firstName = $firstName;
    $this->lastName = $lastName;
    $this->age = $age;
}
```

### 5. Visibility: Public, Private, and Protected

Properties and methods can have different visibility levels which determine their accessibility.

-   `public`: Accessible from anywhere.
-   `private`: Accessible only within the class itself.
-   `protected`: Accessible within the class and by classes derived from that class.

#### Syntax:

```php
public $property;
private $property;
protected $property;

public function method() {
    // Code
}
```

#### Example:

```php
class Car {
    public $make;
    private $model;
    protected $year;

    public function __construct($make, $model, $year) {
        $this->make = $make;
        $this->model = $model;
        $this->year = $year;
    }

    public function getModel() {
        return $this->model;
    }
}

$car = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020);
echo $car->make; // Output: Toyota
echo $car->getModel(); // Output: Corolla
```

### 6. Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class using the `extends` keyword.

#### Syntax:

```php
class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
    // Additional properties and methods
}
```

#### Example:

```php
class Employee {
    public $name;
    public $position;

    public function __construct($name, $position) {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->position = $position;
    }
}

class Manager extends Employee {
    public function displayPosition() {
        echo $this->name . " is a " . $this->position;
    }
}

$manager = new Manager("Alice", "Manager");
$manager->displayPosition(); // Output: Alice is a Manager
```

### Key Points:

-   **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects.
-   **Object**: An instance of a class.
-   **Constructor**: A special method to initialize properties.
-   **Visibility**: Determines the accessibility of properties and methods.
-   **Inheritance**: Mechanism to create a new class from an existing class.

### Use Cases:

-   **Modeling real-world entities**: Classes like `Person`, `Car`, `Employee` to model entities with properties and behaviors.
-   **Code reuse**: Inheritance allows extending existing classes and reusing code.
-   **Encapsulation**: Using visibility modifiers to control access to properties and methods.

# Object Output Methods

Outputting an object in PHP can be done in several ways, depending on what information you want to display and how you want to format it. Here’s a detailed explanation of different methods to output an object in PHP:

### 1. Using `print_r()`

`print_r()` is a built-in PHP function that prints human-readable information about a variable, including objects.

#### Syntax:

```php
print_r($object);
```

#### Example:

```php
<?php
class Person {
    public $firstName;
    public $lastName;
    public $age;

    public function __construct($firstName, $lastName, $age) {
        $this->firstName = $firstName;
        $this->lastName = $lastName;
        $this->age = $age;
    }
}

$person = new Person("John", "Doe", 30);
print_r($person);
?>
```

#### Output:

```
Person Object
(
    [firstName] => John
    [lastName] => Doe
    [age] => 30
)
```

### 2. Using `var_dump()`

`var_dump()` is another built-in PHP function that displays detailed information about a variable, including its type and value.

#### Syntax:

```php
var_dump($object);
```

#### Example:

```php
<?php
class Car {
    public $make;
    public $model;
    public $year;

    public function __construct($make, $model, $year) {
        $this->make = $make;
        $this->model = $model;
        $this->year = $year;
    }
}

$car = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020);
var_dump($car);
?>
```

#### Output:

```
object(Car)#1 (3) {
  ["make"]=>
  string(6) "Toyota"
  ["model"]=>
  string(7) "Corolla"
  ["year"]=>
  int(2020)
}
```

### 3. Using `json_encode()`

`json_encode()` converts an object to a JSON string, which can be useful for outputting data in a structured format that is easy to read and parse.

#### Syntax:

```php
echo json_encode($object);
```

#### Example:

```php
<?php
class Book {
    public $title;
    public $author;
    public $year;

    public function __construct($title, $author, $year) {
        $this->title = $title;
        $this->author = $author;
        $this->year = $year;
    }
}

$book = new Book("1984", "George Orwell", 1949);
echo json_encode($book);
?>
```

#### Output:

```json
{ "title": "1984", "author": "George Orwell", "year": 1949 }
```

### 4. Custom Method for Displaying Object Properties

You can also define a custom method within the class to output its properties in a specific format.

#### Syntax:

```php
class ClassName {
    // Class properties and methods

    public function display() {
        // Custom code to display properties
    }
}
```

#### Example:

```php
<?php
class Employee {
    public $name;
    public $position;
    public $salary;

    public function __construct($name, $position, $salary) {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->position = $position;
        $this->salary = $salary;
    }

    public function display() {
        echo "Name: " . $this->name . "<br>";
        echo "Position: " . $this->position . "<br>";
        echo "Salary: " . $this->salary . "<br>";
    }
}

$employee = new Employee("Alice", "Manager", 60000);
$employee->display();
?>
```

#### Output:

```
Name: Alice
Position: Manager
Salary: 60000
```

### Summary

PHP provides multiple methods for outputting objects, including `print_r()` for a human-readable format, `var_dump()` for detailed type and value information, `json_encode()` for structured JSON output, and custom methods within the class for tailored displays. Choose the method that best fits your needs based on the context and the information you need to present.

# Object Methods

In PHP, object methods are functions defined inside a class that can operate on objects created from that class. These methods can access and manipulate the properties of the object and perform operations relevant to the object's purpose. Here’s a detailed explanation of object methods in PHP, including syntax, examples, key points, and use cases.

### 1. Defining Methods

Methods in a PHP class are defined like regular functions, but they reside within a class and can access the class's properties and other methods using `$this`.

#### Syntax:

```php
class ClassName {
    public function methodName() {
        // Method body
    }
}
```

#### Example:

```php
class Person {
    public $firstName;
    public $lastName;

    public function __construct($firstName, $lastName) {
        $this->firstName = $firstName;
        $this->lastName = $lastName;
    }

    public function fullName() {
        return $this->firstName . " " . $this->lastName;
    }
}

$person = new Person("John", "Doe");
echo $person->fullName(); // Output: John Doe
```

### 2. Visibility of Methods

Methods can have different visibility levels which determine their accessibility:

-   `public`: Accessible from anywhere.
-   `private`: Accessible only within the class itself.
-   `protected`: Accessible within the class and by classes derived from that class.

#### Syntax:

```php
class ClassName {
    public function publicMethod() {
        // Public method body
    }

    private function privateMethod() {
        // Private method body
    }

    protected function protectedMethod() {
        // Protected method body
    }
}
```

#### Example:

```php
class Car {
    public $make;
    private $model;
    protected $year;

    public function __construct($make, $model, $year) {
        $this->make = $make;
        $this->model = $model;
        $this->year = $year;
    }

    public function getModel() {
        return $this->model;
    }

    protected function getYear() {
        return $this->year;
    }
}

$car = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2020);
echo $car->getModel(); // Output: Corolla
// echo $car->getYear(); // Error: Call to protected method Car::getYear()
```

### 3. Static Methods

Static methods belong to the class rather than any object instance and are called using the scope resolution operator `::`.

#### Syntax:

```php
class ClassName {
    public static function staticMethod() {
        // Method body
    }
}
```

#### Example:

```php
class MathOperations {
    public static function add($a, $b) {
        return $a + $b;
    }
}

echo MathOperations::add(5, 3); // Output: 8
```

### 4. Method Overriding

In a subclass, you can override a method of the parent class to provide a new implementation.

#### Syntax:

```php
class ParentClass {
    public function methodName() {
        // Parent method body
    }
}

class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
    public function methodName() {
        // Child method body
    }
}
```

#### Example:

```php
class Animal {
    public function makeSound() {
        return "Some generic sound";
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    public function makeSound() {
        return "Bark";
    }
}

$dog = new Dog();
echo $dog->makeSound(); // Output: Bark
```

### 5. Calling Parent Methods

In a subclass, you can call a method from the parent class using `parent::`.

#### Syntax:

```php
class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
    public function methodName() {
        parent::methodName();
        // Additional code
    }
}
```

#### Example:

```php
class Animal {
    public function makeSound() {
        return "Some generic sound";
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    public function makeSound() {
        return parent::makeSound() . " and Meow";
    }
}

$cat = new Cat();
echo $cat->makeSound(); // Output: Some generic sound and Meow
```

### Key Points:

-   **Method Definition**: Methods are functions within a class that can access and manipulate the class’s properties and other methods.
-   **Visibility**: Public, private, and protected methods determine accessibility.
-   **Static Methods**: Belong to the class and not instances, called using `::`.
-   **Overriding**: Subclasses can provide new implementations for parent class methods.
-   **Parent Methods**: Use `parent::` to call parent class methods from a subclass.

### Use Cases:

-   **Encapsulation**: Methods provide a way to encapsulate functionality within a class.
-   **Inheritance**: Overriding and parent methods allow for extending and modifying class behavior in subclasses.
-   **Utility Functions**: Static methods can provide utility functions related to the class but not tied to object instances.
